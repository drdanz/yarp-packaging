# This script configures a build directory.  To use it, do something like:
#   mkdir build
#   cd build
#   $SOURCE_DIR/manage.sh
# where $SOURCE_DIR is the path to this script.
#
# This will list a set of "bundles" that can be built.  Each named
# bundle $BUNDLE corresponds to specific versions of software packages 
# used to put together a named binary release.
#
# Each bundle $BUNDLE corresponds to a file named:
#   $SOURCE_DIR/conf/bundle-$BUNDLE.sh
# To see the versions of software involved in a bundle, read that file.
# If no bundle file exists that does what you want, make a new one.
# Then, in your build directory $BUILD_DIR, do:
#   $SOURCE_DIR/manage.sh $BUNDLE
# This will produce at least the following files:
#   $BUILD_DIR/Makefile     # targets for building release
#   $BUILD_DIR/settings.sh  # cache of build variables, including $BUNDLE
#

# For simplicity, make sure this script is not called in-place
